  <li><b>Step 1: Boil Water</b></li>
  <br>
    <dd>Start with a very large pot of water, about 6 quarts per pound of pasta.</dd>
    <dd>Bring it to a rapid boil.</dd>
    <dd>Tip: A pound of pasta feeds about 5 to 6 people.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 2: Add Salt</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>Put in a lot of salt, about 3 tablespoons.</dd>
  <dd>You taste the water, it should taste like the sea.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 3: Add the Pasta</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>Drop in the pasta while the water is at a boil and give it a gentle stir.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 4: Stir</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>Stir it occasionally while it cooks.</dd> 
  <dd>Use the cooking time on the pasta package as a guide.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 5: Taste the Pasta</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>But watch out — it's hot! Sample the pasta at about 2 minutes shy of the indicated time.</dd> 
  <dd>It should be al dente. You'll finish cooking it in the sauce.</dd>
  <dd>Tip: "Al dente" means "to the tooth," meaning the pasta should still have a little bite to it.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 6: Drain</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>Drain the pasta. Just be sure to save about 1 cup of the pasta water.</dd>
  <dd>If you have a pot with a colander insert, use it to drain the pasta.</dd>
  <dd>If not, drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 7: Removing Ravioli</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>If you're cooking ravioli, use a slotted skimmer and gently lift the ravioli a few at a time.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 8: Stir in the Sauce</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>Add the pasta to your sauce and finish cooking it in the sauce. Give it a stir to coat.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 9: Add Pasta Water</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>Ladle a few tablespoons of the pasta water at a time until you have the right consistency to your sauce.</dd>
  <dd>Remember, the pasta will absorb the liquid. Tip: Pasta water helps to thicken the sauce.</dd>
  <br>
  <li><b>Step 10: Buon Appetito!</b></li>
  <br>
  <dd>Simmer over medium-low heat — it'll help the pasta soak up the sauce.</dd>
  <dd>Follow your recipe's instructions for finishing the dish. And that's all there is to it.</dd>
