      <h1>History of Coffee</h1>
    <font size="4"><p>According to legend -and this is the most commonly cited story of coffee’s origin- the energizing effects of the coffee bean were first noticed by a goat herder called Kaldi, who lived on the Ethiopian plateau way back during the 9th century.

        One day Kaldi noticed that after some of his heard had grazed on the bright red cherry of the coffee plant they seemed to possess boundless energy, certainly more than the rest of his animals. As the story goes, this left them too energized to fall asleep at night, as their bundles of energy had them bounding all over the place.
        
        From here, Kaldi tried the beans himself and found that they really were very invigorating. He chose to share his new discovery with the local monastery, who disregarded his anecdotes and threw the beans in the fire. A delectable aroma quickly began rising from the fire, and the beans were scrapped out for further investigation.The monks then chose to crush the beans and add them to water. To their surprise, and joy, they found that the beverage gave them the same energy and vigor that it gave Kaldi and his goats, allowing them to stay awake and alert for evening mass. These monks passed their findings on to other monks and monasteries and so began the journey of coffee!

        The earliest copy we have of any text containing this story comes from 1671 -seven hundred years after the fact- and that’s why it’s often cited as legend or myth. But it’s a beginning all the same!</p>

        <h1>What is Coffee?</h1>
      <font size="4"><p>coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin. 
          Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities. 
          Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.
          Two species of coffee plants, Coffea arabica and C. canephora, supply almost all of the world’s consumption. Arabica is considered a milder and more flavourful and aromatic brew than Robusta, the main variety of C. canephora. 
          The flatter and more elongated Arabica bean is more widespread than Robusta but more delicate and vulnerable to pests, requiring a cool subtropical climate; Arabica must grow at higher elevations (2,000–6,500 feet [600–2,000 metres]), it needs a lot of moisture, and it has fairly specific shade requirements. Latin America, eastern Africa, Asia, and Arabia are leading producers of Arabica coffee. 
          The rounder, more convex Robusta bean, as its name suggests, is hardier and can grow at lower altitudes (from sea level to 2,000 feet). Robusta coffee is cheaper to produce, has twice the caffeine content of Arabica, and is typically the bean of choice for inexpensive commercial coffee brands. Western and Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and Brazil are major producers of Robusta coffee.</p></font>

        <h1>Why People Drinking Coffee?</h1>
       <ul type="disc"><font size="4">
         <li>Since coffee contains caffeine, this popular beverage can help people feel less tired, increase energy levels, burn fat by jump-starting the body’s metabolism, and improve productivity and brain function—including memory, mood, reaction times, and general mental function. Although there are many healthful benefits of coffee, consuming it in moderation is still important to avoid side effects, as well as limiting the amount of less-nutritious ingredients like cream and sugar you add to each cup of joe.</li>

For some, the smell and taste of coffee are comforting. If you are deprived of sleep, having a cup of your favorite brew can help you feel more relaxed and ready to be productive. If you live in a cold climate, having a hot cup of coffee can be the ultimate remedy to warm the soul. If you live in a hot climate, you have the option of having your favorite coffee drink iced. Since there are a vast variety of coffee flavors, roasts, and add-ins available on the market, many people can customize their drink to match their exact preferences.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Similar to social alcohol drinking at a bar, people enjoy gathering at coffee shops to meet with friends or to conduct a business meeting.

Need to catch up with your best friend? Have a crush on a special someone? Meeting up for coffee is a great option.
        As you can see, there are various reasons why people drink coffee, so go ahead and enjoy your daily dose of java. Use it to be more productive at home or work, to warm up on a cold day, or as a means to meet up with a friend.</li>
