        <h3>Bad Boys for Life</h3>
        <p>The wife and son of a Mexican drug lord embark on a vengeful quest to kill all those involved in his trial and imprisonment -- including Miami Detective Mike Lowrey. 
            When Mike gets wounded, he teams up with partner Marcus Burnett and AMMO -- a special tactical squad -- to bring the culprits to justice. 
            But the old-school, wisecracking cops must soon learn to get along with their new elite counterparts if they are to take down the vicious cartel that threatens their lives.

        <h3>Mango</h3>
        <p>Mango is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and it has been associated with many health benefits, 
            including potential anticancer effects, as well as improved immunity and digestive and eye health. 
            Best of all, it's tasty and easy to add to your diet as part of smoothies and many other dishes.

        <h3>Game of the Generals </h3>
        <p>The game simulates armies at war trying to overpower, misinform, outflank, outmaneuver and destroy each other. 
            It optimizes the use of logic, memory, and spatial skills. It simulates the "fog of war" 
            because the identities of the opposing pieces are hidden from each player and can only be guessed at by their location, 
            movements or from the results of challenges. The game allows only one side's plan to succeed, 
            although a player may change plans during the course of the game. In addition, there are two different ways of winning the game (see below). 
            Certain strategies and tactics, however, allow both sides the chance of securing a better idea of the other's plan as the game progresses. 
            Players can also speak or gesture to their opponents during matches, hoping to create a false impression about the identity of their pieces or their overall strategy.
